# swappa-price-alert
I wanted to buy an iPhone from the Swappa. Till the time, I check my mails for new listing, all the good phones were already gone. So I created a mac notifier which will notify me as soon as new listing is posted on Swappa. It also tells me the price - so that I can act accordingly.

##Installation


You will need to get the [terminal-notifier](https://github.com/julienXX/terminal-notifier) which we will use to get the realtime notification of the Swappa as soon as somebody posts. You can install it by running the following command:
```
$ brew install terminal-notifier
```

You run the python program:
```
$ python swappa.py
```
