You will need to get the [terminal-notifier](https://github.com/julienXX/terminal-notifier) which we will use to get the realtime notification of the Swappa as soon as somebody posts. You can install it by running the following command:
```
$ brew install terminal-notifier
```

You run the python program:
```
$ python swappa.py
```
